                                    An educated, informed and efficient decision making process requires endless streams of data pouring into the enterprise applications to be separated from noise, cleaned and converted into usable information. Once the data is available in a usable clean format the next obvious step involves analysis to generate insights. Depending upon the need of the hour the insights can be plugged into a predictive analytics model to forecast or into an optimization model to help pick up the most optimal option keeping in view all the constraints. Crisp’s platform provides quick, flexible and efficient Prediction and Optimization models tailored and customized by industry.

                            The complex relationships amongst different elements need to be understood before the data can be used for any other purpose. These relationships as well as interaction between the data elements are typically referred to insights and form the basis of use of data be it for predictive analytics or optimization or for any other purpose. This insight generation process forms the backbone of today’s data driven decision making platforms and our solution provides the capability to mine available data across different functions and generate these insights. Depending upon the industry and the target solution area the techniques involved may be like principle component analysis, factor analysis, clustering, regression etc.

                            Hundreds of decisions are made in today's enterprises by teams spread across geographies. Strategic, tactical and operational decisions are all happening in tandem and drive the planing to executions cycles. The time horizons involved put up a unique challenge in terms of speed and the quality of the decision. In order to handle to all possible scenarios we support both exact methods like integer programming, mixed-integer, integer programming as well as approximate methods (heuristics and meta-heuristics) like Genetic Algorithms, Tabu Search, simulated annealing etc. The exact models to be used are decided on the basis of required balance between quality (optimality) vs. the solution time

                            Predictive modelling offers a peek into the future based on a clear understanding of the past and the present. Our platforms are designed to help discover the data elements and their hidden relationships and use these insights to predict the future events with confidence thereby enabling decision makers to take insights driven decisions. Depending upon the industry and type of the problem being addressed we provide the ability to choose models based on self-learning (machine learning, neural networks) to simple regression.
